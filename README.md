```
## DESIGN STEPS:
### Step 1 (Acquire Evidence Image):
- Obtain the disk image in ```.dd``` or ```.E01``` format from a trusted forensic acquisition process.
- Verify hash values (MD5/SHA256) to maintain integrity.

### Step 2(Load Image into Forensic Tool):
- Open Autopsy or FTK Imager.
- Create a new case and add the evidence image.

### Step 3(Locate Unallocated Space):
- Navigate to the partition structure view.
- Identify sectors not assigned to any partition (unallocated).
### Step 4(Analyze & Carve Data):
- Use built-in data carving tools to search for file signatures (JPEG, DOCX, PDF, etc.).
- Preview carved files for relevance.
